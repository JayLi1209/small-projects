# Small Projects

> These are Jay's first four projects in HTML/CSS.

## Hubble Banner
This project includes the use of background images, Google fonts, and basic layouts.

## Navigation Bar
This project includes the use of adjusting icons (from [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com/)), use of lists and attaching links.

## Sign-in form
The user sign-in form includes basic Forms in HTML, adjusting icons and layouts, and designing good hierarchy systems.

## Name Card
Using CSS animations, basic layouts, and integrating the techniques in previous sections, I created a name card for myself.

Here is a preview of the projects:
